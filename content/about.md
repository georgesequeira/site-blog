I'm currently building Hemisphere. I most recently co-founded RevvUp — a company exploring opportunities in auto repair. Before that I had the good fortune to work at Bonsai, Bluecore, Amazon and a few other places.

As a leader in early stage startups, my experiences have focused on building amazing teams, executing in ambiguous situations, and delivering products that move the business forward. I focus on supporting people with tools, systems, processes that empower them to do their best work.

I’m always excited to hear from folks, please feel free to connect:

Email (g@georgesequeira.com) is best.
