List of things that I don't want to forget to do

## Todo

- Bring all h1,h2,h3 stuff over from medium
- First tag when listed on main page.
- first tag on the post itself (not this cloud thing)
- images aren't doing well because of inline-block
- Add in the anchor tags like PaperMod has.
- pagination working?
- table of contents like in papaermod
- favicon
- how to create breaks (line breaks)
- on screen re-size to small, newline the menu items
- list spacing in <p> should be bgger
- make the date come before the title when lists of articles are shown (not index.html)

## Done

- figure out formatting of images + caption. - center + grey like on medium
- list looks like stars - lets make them dots
- center justify the things that are under the images
- test bringing in zapier post
- Updates tags page to look like just a dumb list (maybe count?)
- spacing between menu items
- change "highlights" to be red + have underline.
- update posts on the mainpage to not be red (but have outline)
- (done) how do callouts work in markdown
- fix callout formatting
- Format tags on individual pages like medium == did it different.
- add "read more" on the bottom of posts too
